							<h3>PERMANENT STAFFING</h3>
							<p class="text_align">
								Permanent staffing is not a business we take lightly here at Prabal Solutions. In other words, we have a broad outlook on staffing talents and our practice is not only to match people who will be the best at what they do but also to provide them with a rooting system that helps grow a mutually beneficial relationship rooted in sound practices for years to come. 
							</p>
							<p class="text_align">
								We understand how important it is for people to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves and we're more interested in matching these people with your organization because we believe that when you find a good fit, there's no problem you can't solve together! Our methodology starts with making sure that the employees and their employers both know each other well so as to help tamp down any misgivings and make room for people who really want the work.
							</p>
							<p class="text_align">
								We provide niche talent while ensuring our service delivery teams are specialized by industry and function to fulfill your needs through customized processes. Our extensive experience in the completion of turnkey staffing projects as well as time-bound and results-oriented service level agreements (SLAs) enables us to make niche talent a reality.

							<h3>CONTRACT STAFFING</h3>
							<p class="text_align">
								Prabal Solution’s contract staffing service helps your team identify qualified candidates on a temporary and contingent basis. Since it is difficult to find candidates who are qualified and convenient for companies, Prabal Solutions does temporary hiring for you to make it easier to hire top-tier talents.
							</p>
							<p class="text_align">
								We have stepped up to hire candidates for companies looking to hire candidates on a temporary basis. We take full responsibility for evaluating the suitability of candidates for your company. 
							</p>
							<p class="text_align">
								Our priority is to make sure we focus on the core aspects of recruitment, i.e. excellence and quality, and make sure they are reflected in our services. Our contract employment services meet all the project hiring needs you want immediately, so we can hire the talent when they are required in your company.

							<h3>CONTRACT-TO-HIRE STAFFING</h3>
							<p class="text_align">
								A great organization does not emerge overnight. It takes the right strategy and years of hard work. In order to achieve this, you need to hire the right team at every stage of your growth, and Prabal Solutions will help you achieve that growth.
							</p>
							<p class="text_align">
								Out of our assorted candidate list, the person your company thinks eligible begins the employment contract on our agency’s payroll. The contract duration can vary and in almost all situations, the client has the option of hiring the employee full time or terminating the contract employment.
							</p>
							<p class="text_align">
								At Prabal Solution, our contract-to-hire staffing services will allow your company to take advantage of the traditional agency services with the option to hire the employee permanently. Instead of hiring on a long-term basis immediately and having to rehire when plans change, our contract-to-hire program gives you the opportunity to see exactly what you're getting yourself into before making a permanent hire.
